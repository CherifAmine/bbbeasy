# Contributing guide

Welcome to the BBBeasy community!

## BBBeasy development community

The primary communication ground for the BBBeasy community is the Github
discussions available at [github.com/riadvice/bbbeasy/discussions](https://github.com/riadvice/bbbeasy/discussions):

- **Users** and **administrators** of BBBeasy stop by to
  ask questions, offer feedback, and participate in product design
  discussions.
- **Contributors to the project**, including the **core BBBeasy
  development team**, discuss ongoing and future projects, brainstorm
  ideas, and generally help each other out.

We love hearing from our users!
